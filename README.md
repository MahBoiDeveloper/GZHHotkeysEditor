# C&C: Generals — Zero Hour Hotkeys Editor
## About the project
GZHHotkeysEditor is an attempt to create a useful tool for editing C&C: Generals and C&C: Generals - Zero Hour hotkeys without editing the main game text file (`generals.csf`). At the moment the editor is in alpha stage, which means that the program is unstable and many features aren't implemented yet.
