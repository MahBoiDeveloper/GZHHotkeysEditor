# C&C: Generals - Zero Hour Hotkeys Editor
## About the project
GZHHotkeysEditor is an attempt to create a useful tool for editing C&C: Generals and C&C: Generals - Zero Hour hotkeys without editing the main game text file (generals.csf). At the moment the editor is in alpha stage, which means that the program is unstable and many features aren't implemented yet.

## Future features
* C&C: Generals â€” Zero Hour support
* C&C: Generals support
* Mod support (GZH only)
* Multilanguage support
* GUI customization
* Discord Rich Presence

## License
Currently [GNU GPL v3](https://github.com/MahBoiDeveloper/GZHHotkeysEditor/blob/main/LICENSE) but maybe we (developers) change it to LGPL or something.
